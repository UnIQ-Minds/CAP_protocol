## Cross-Chain Action Protocol (CAP)
"IFTTT for Multi-Chain Workflows with Zero-Code Automation"

## Overview
Cross-Chain Action Protocol (CAP) is a no-code automation platform that allows DAOs and Web3 projects to create rule-based workflows across multiple blockchainsâ€”without needing developer expertise.

With CAP, users can set up automated actions like:
When ETH balance on Arbitrum > 1 ETH, auto-stake ICP at 7% APY
When an NFT is minted on Solana, trigger a mirrored DAO on ICP

Powered by the Internet Computer (ICP)
CAP leverages Chain-key Signatures, HTTPS Outcalls, Canister Heartbeats, and Internet Identity to provide a trustless, decentralized, and secure automation layer.

 Features
ðŸ”¹ No-Code Workflow Builder â€“ Drag-and-drop rule editor to create complex automation workflows.
ðŸ”¹ Multi-Chain Compatibility â€“ Automate transactions across Ethereum, Solana, Bitcoin (ckBTC), ICP, and more.
ðŸ”¹ Trustless Execution â€“ Removes dependency on centralized relayers with ICPâ€™s cryptographic mechanisms.
ðŸ”¹ Template Marketplace â€“ Pre-built workflows for DeFi strategies, DAO governance, cross-chain asset management.
ðŸ”¹ Enterprise-Grade Security â€“ Multi-signature approvals, Threshold Encryption, and Regulatory Compliance Modules.

Tech Stack
ðŸ”¹ Frontend â€“ React.js + TailwindCSS
ðŸ”¹ Backend â€“ Internet Computer Canisters (Rust & Motoko)
ðŸ”¹ Smart Contracts â€“ ICP Chain-Key Signatures, EVM Smart Contracts
ðŸ”¹ Database â€“ Decentralized storage using ICP Canisters
ðŸ”¹ Multi-Chain Integration â€“ HTTPS Outcalls for cross-chain interactions
